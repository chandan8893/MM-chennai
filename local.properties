Clone
Clone operation creates the instance of the repository. Clone operation not only
checks out the working copy, but it also mirrors the complete repository. Users
can perform many operations with this local repository. The only time
networking gets involved is when the repository instances are being
synchronized.
Pull
Pull operation copies the changes from a remote repository instance to a local
one. The pull operation is used for synchronization between two repository
instances. This is same as the update operation in Subversion.
Push
Push operation copies changes from a local repository instance to a remote one.
This is used to store the changes permanently into the Git repository. This is
same as the commit operation in Subversion.
HEAD
HEAD is a pointer, which always points to the latest commit in the branch.
Whenever you make a commit, HEAD is updated with the latest commit. The
heads of the branches are stored in .git/refs/heads/ directory.
[CentOS]$ ls -1 .git/refs/heads/
master
[CentOS]$ cat .git/refs/heads/master
